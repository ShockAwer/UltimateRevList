https://kamtape.com - A recreation of YouTube in 2005. Everything else here will be strictly within its timeline or similar to it.
https://aolemu.com/ - Neat little recreation of AOL. It's not that good as in it's composed mainly of shitty images of the AOL client with text imposed on it, but otherwise it is decent.
https://runningman.network/ - Phoenix but much better, basically a revival of AIM.
https://escargot.chat - MSN revived.
Snippr (NOT PUBLIC YET) - A recreation of Flickr circa July 2004.
https://habbo.bz - Faithful recreation of 2006 Habbo.
https://friendproject.net - Myspace circa 2006 mixed in with it circa 2009. Not intended to be a revival, but it uses old Myspace HTML for almost everything, so go crazy. The overall vibe is much better than SH, anyways.
